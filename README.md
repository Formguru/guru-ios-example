#  Guru iOS SDK Example App

This example application shows how easy it is to use the [guru-ios-sdk](https://github.com/Formguru/guru-swift-sdk/)
from an application.

To get started, simply grab your API Key and Schema ID from the Deploy tab of the Guru IDE, and copy the values
into the `apiKey` and `schemaId` variables declared at the top of `ExampleGuruApp`. After that, you're ready
to run and test out your schema on-device!
